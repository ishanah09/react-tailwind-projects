A responsive dessert ordering cart app built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Users can browse a list of desserts, add them to a cart, adjust quantities, and confirm their order — with real-time cart totals and confirmation modal.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Global state management using `useReducer` and `useContext`

- Component structure for modular cart/product systems
- Tailwind’s responsive grid system and custom color palettes
- Handling modal overlays and conditional rendering
